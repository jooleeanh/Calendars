        "description": "For this all-Russian program, superstar Chinese pianist Lang Lang joins Andris Nelsons and the BSO as soloist in Sergei Prokofiev's brilliant, witty Piano Concerto No. 3. The composer himself was soloist in the premiere in front of an unenthusiastic Chicago audience in 1921, but in short order this sparkling, virtuosic piece became one of the most popular of 20th-century concertos. Opening the concert is the celebratory Festive Overture of Dmitri Shostakovich, who wrote this short, exciting piece for the Bolshoi Theatre to mark the 37th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The great orchestral showpiece Pictures at an Exhibition-Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's solo-piano impressions of a series of paintings and illustrations-closes the program. Ravel made this famous orchestration for legendary BSO conductor Serge Koussevitzky.",

The first Casual Friday of 2016-17 pairs Dmitri Shostakovich's brief but exciting Festive Overture, written in 1954 to mark the 37th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, with French composer Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. Originally for solo piano, this familiar but always scintillating orchestral tour-de-force provides a musical depiction of an imagined stroll through a gallery of paintings and drawings, ranging from a fantastic gnome and a buoyant ballet of chicks in their shells to the dark shadows of subterranean catacombs and the majestic splendor of the Great Gate of Kiev.",

Composers to be discussed will include Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Vivaldi, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, and Mahler.

The program of works by three 20th-century English composers opens with William Walton's Portsmouth Point Overture, a vibrant and jazzy early work inspired by a print of colorful activity at a seaport. Written between 1914 and 1916, Gustav Holst's astrologically inspired The Planetsis by far his most enduringly popular work, a series of orchestrally rich character pieces, from fleet Mercury to mysterious Neptune.",

Mehta and the Lorelei Ensemble gave the American premiere of the piece with the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra in July 2016. Opening the program is Ravel's colorful orchestral version of his solo piano suite  Le Tombeau de Couperin, inspired in part by the French Baroque composer François Couperin. Berlioz'sSymphonie fantastique, his first masterpiece, is innovative in form, remarkably forward-thinking in its use of the orchestra, and quintessentially Romantic in its depiction of an artist's unrequited love.",

Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique has its calm passages, but also includes musical depictions of hallucinations, murder, execution, and a chilling finale that depicts a witches' sabbath. George Benjamin's colorful Dream of the Song sets verse inspired by the Arabic poetry that flowered in Andalusia from the ninth century onwards.",

        "description": "American cellist Alisa Weilerstein joins French conductor François-Xavier Roth for the world premiere of the BSO-commissioned un despertar, for cello and orchestra by German composer Matthias Pintscher, with whom Weilerstein has collaborated in the past. Pintscher, also a noted conductor, is a major figure in classical music in both Europe and the U.S. Opening the program is Hector Berlioz's alternately romantic and swashbuckling Le Corsaire Overture, which, as was often the composer's practice, took shape from earlier sketches. The title is an incidental reference to James Fenimore Cooper's The Red Rover (\"Le Corsaire rouge\"). Beethoven's Symphony No. 6, Pastoral, is his only explicitly programmatic symphony, a fundamentally cheerful work illustrating a sojourn in the countryside.",

Berlioz's  Le Corsaire Overture, by turns romantic and exuberant, opens the program. Albert Roussel's Suite No. 2 from his 1930 ballet  Bacchus et Ariane was strongly championed with the BSO by Charles Munch. It was also Munch who introduced Henri Dutilleux's music to the orchestra and called for the commission of his atmospheric Symphony No. 2,  Le Double, to commemorate the BSO's 75th anniversary.",

Bruckner's seldom heard Symphony No. 6, written between 1879 and 1881, was the work he considered his boldest, though only the second and third movements were performed during his lifetime. Gustav Mahler led all four movements-but with cuts-in 1899, in Vienna; the first complete, uncut performance was given in 1901, in Stuttgart. Energetic, lyrical, and expansive, the Symphony No. 6 is a uniquely absorbing example of the composer's monumental symphonic style.",

The superb German violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter opens the concert with Tchaikovsky's evergreen Violin Concerto, among the most popular works in the repertoire. Known for her exploration of contemporary repertoire, Ms. Mutter also performs Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu's 1987 homage to the phenomenal Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky.
